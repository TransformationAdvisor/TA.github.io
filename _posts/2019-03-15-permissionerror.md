Migrated apps stand up in a Liberty container with the base image "websphere-liberty:webProfile7". 

The base image might change over time but "docker pull... " command won't pull the new image if it is already present on your machine.

Please delete the old websphere-liberty:webProfile7 image from your machine to enforce pulling the most up to date version from the Dockerfile.

{% highlight ruby %}  
> docker rmi -f websphere-liberty:webProfile7
{% endhighlight %}

Also make sure to use  Dockerfile generated by latest TA version.
