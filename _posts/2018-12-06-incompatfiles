title: "INCOMPATIBLE FILES DETECTED" error during upload
categories: Datacollector Execution
---

The data collector produces reports that are linked to each application
In this case the process to link the report to an application has failed
This means one or more applications were not processed correctly

You can resolve this issue as follows:
```
1. Explode the profile.zip file
2. Delete files with the following names: 
     InventoryReport.json, InventoryReport.html, AnalysisReport.json, 
     AnalysisReport.html, TechnologyReport.json, TechnologyReport.html
3. Manually upload the zip file to Transformation Advisor through the UI

You may be missing some applications. You can determine the missing applications as follows:
1. Get the list of applications in Transformation Advisor
2. Look at the profiles directory in <WAS_HOME> to see the full list of applications installed in that profile
3. Identify the applications in the profile that are missing from Transformation Advisor
```
