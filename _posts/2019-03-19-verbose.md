You can enable verbose logging for the binary scanner tool that the data collector runs. The verbose logging will be available to you in trace files which are generated in the directory where you run the data collector. To enable verbose logging use the "--verbose" option on the command line.
Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
./bin/transformationadvisor 
-w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/
-p AppSrv01 admin admin
--verbose
{% endhighlight %}
