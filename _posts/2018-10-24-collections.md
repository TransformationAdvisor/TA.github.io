You can name collections anything that you find helpful to organise your work under your workspace. 

Taking WAS as an example, a WAS server can have many profiles. Each of these profiles may have many applications. So when you run the DC against a WAS server you will potentially get multiple apps for each profile, from just this server. Then of course you may have more than one WAS server. So you could name the collection the same name as the WAS server you are scanning and under that collection you will then have the multiple profiles and applications for that server you ran the DC on - but there are lots of other ways to name what you are doing.
