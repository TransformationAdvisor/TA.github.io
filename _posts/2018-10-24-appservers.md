The TA data collector tool scans for known issues in applications that are migrated from WebLogic Server and JBoss Application Server to WebSphere Application Server. Where possible, a quick fix is provided to change your code to a more portable solution. 

You can use the quick fix to help you decide if you want to accept the suggested code change. Also, view the help information provided with the rules to decide if you want to run the quick fix. Always make a backup copy of your source code before you start a migration. 

For some rules, the scan detects code that requires design changes and code rewrites. The tools highlight these problem areas but do not provide a quick fix.
