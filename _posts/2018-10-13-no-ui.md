Firstly you should wait a few minutes, TA has a database that needs to start up before the UI. You can check the status of the pods by navigating from the ICP menu to Deployments

and checking that all three transadv pods are Ready and Available (a zero will show if not)

If after a few minutes any or all of the pods are still not available, try re-generating the pod. To do this in the deployments screen select the three dots at the end of the row corresponding to the pod you wish to re-generate and select Remove. This should generate a new pod. If all the pods are available but system is still not responsive try removing the server pod.

Lastly ensure that you have enough resources to run ICP. ICP needs at least 12 CPU and 20 GB RAM for it to be stable. If you also have Microclimate installed you will need 32 GB of RAM.
