You can use the option -J-Xmx in the command line to customize the maximum heap size used by data collector tool
Here is an example to set the maximum heap size to 2 GB:

{% highlight ruby %}
./bin/transformationadvisor -J-Xmx2G -w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/ -p AppSrv01 admin admin
{% endhighlight %}
