title: Authentication endpoint is broken at the moment

When running Transformation Advisor on Red Hat OCP, it works but after I leave it for a while and come back to it I get the message :

'Authentication endpoint is broken at the moment'

This is an issue with the auth cookie, after 12 hours. 

To resolve either delete the ta-access-token-cookie and refresh, or kill your browser and restart.
