title: com.ibm packages are not being scanned

com.ibm is one of the ignored packages in the binary scanner. 

The Datacollector can be configured to ignore certain packages. 
There is a *customCmd.properties* file in *$TA_HOME/conf* directory. 
You can uncomment the line and modify the command to include com.ibm package. 
If there are uncommented commands in this file, the Datacollector will include 
those commands when invoking the binary scanner.
