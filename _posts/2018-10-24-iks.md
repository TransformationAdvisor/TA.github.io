For Liberty on Public Cloud we give you artifacts to build what you need and specific instructions on how to migrate to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Servce (IKS) if you want to do it manually. Alternatively you can use the “Deploy” button to deploy the application into ICP through TA, you can then re-use microclimate to deploy into IKS.  You can associate your microclimate project with an IKS pipeline.  Doc for microclimate deployment into IKS is here: https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/deployingiks
