By default transformation advisor data collector tool will use the java defined in path.
If you want to use a specific JRE for the data collector tool,  you can include -java-home option in the command.
Here is an example:

{% highlight ruby %}
./bin/transformationadvisor -java-home /opt/ibm/java-x86_64-80 
-w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/ 
-p AppSrv01 admin admin
{% endhighlight %}
