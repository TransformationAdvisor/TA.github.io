By default, transformation advisor data collector tool will automatically determine which Java to use based on the following rules:
1. If collecting from WebSphere Application Server, use the Java that is installed with WebSphere Application Server
2. Use the Java that is on the path
3. Use the Java that is shipped with the data collector  

If you want to use a specific JRE for the data collector tool, you can include --java-home option in the command. This option will override the scheme outlined above.
Here is an example:

{% highlight ruby %}
./bin/transformationadvisor --java-home /opt/ibm/java-x86_64-80 
-w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/ 
-p AppSrv01 admin admin
{% endhighlight %}

*Note:* If you are collecting data from IBM MQ, the version of Java shipped with the data collector will always be used.
