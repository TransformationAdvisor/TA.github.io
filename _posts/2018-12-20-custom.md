Transformation Advisor will automatically find your custom profiles if you supply the correct profile name. 

If for some reason this is not working then follow the steps below:

Create a symbolic link from the profiles directory in WAS_HOME to the location of the custom directory using this command

{% highlight ruby %}
ln -s <CUSTOM_PROFILE_LOCATON>/<CUSTOM_PROFILE_NAME> <WAS_HOME>/profiles/<CUSTOM_PROFILE_NAME>
{% endhighlight %}

Example: A custom profile called appProfile has been created outside of WAS_HOME

{% highlight ruby %}
ln -s /was7/appProfile/ /ibm/was/profiles/appProfile
{% endhighlight %}
