title: Your version of Java does not support TLS 1.2
categories: Datacollector

When Data Collection has been completed the results are uploaded to Transformation Advisor
If you are using an older version of Java6 it may not support TLS1.2, which is required for connection

It is recommended that you manually upload the zip result files via the Transformation Advisor UI

Alternativel you can:
 - Rerun the command using the -java-home param and point to the JRE provided in the Data Collector
 - Upgrade to Oracle Java 1.6.0_181-b10 or newer
 - Upgrade to IBM Java 6.0.16.40 or newer
