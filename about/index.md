**What is Application modernization**
Cloud  environments  and services  have  exploded  the  possibilities  for deriving  value  from  existing  and  new  data  sources.  Application requirements in the cognitive era have changed significantly, so in order to respond  to  this changing  market  dynamic businesse must  be  able  to modernize  their  existing  applications  while  maintaining  control  of  their budgets, managing risk, andinvesting in new innovations. For many, application  modernization is just part of a larger digital transformation. The challenge is to find a platform that allows both existing and  new  applications to  converge, providing a unified solutionthat  is robust, secure, scalable, and extensible,for existing and new applications alike. 

The business expects faster implementation of new ideas to capture new markets, launch new products, and provide better services. For a company to be able to complete its transformation it will need to understand its existing applications and how each of the m can become part of the new era. By understanding the business, technical, and economic objectives a company can decide whether an application should be altered or not, and whether it will run best in a private or public cloud environment. 

IBM helps companies throughout their evaluation by providing the Transformation Advisor tool. Transformation Advisor analyses existing applications and assists in their transformation to refactored applications, when required. It provides a solution to  deploy both the old and new applications, either in a private cloud or public cloud, all through a single pane of glass.   

IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor is a free tool developed by IBM and is available from the Catalog when you install IBM Cloud Private.
