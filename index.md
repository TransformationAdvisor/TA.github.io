**What is Modernization?**

Cloud  environments  and services  have  exploded  the  possibilities  for deriving  value  from  existing  and  new  data  sources.  Application requirements in the cognitive era have changed significantly, so in order to respond  to  this changing  market  dynamic business must be  able  to modernize  their  existing  applications  while  maintaining  control  of  their budgets, managing risk, and investing in new innovations. For many, application  modernization is just part of a larger digital transformation. The challenge is to find a platform that allows both existing and  new  applications to  converge, providing a unified solution that  is robust, secure, scalable, and extensible, for existing and new applications alike. 

The business expects faster implementation of new ideas to capture new markets, launch new products, and provide better services. For a company to be able to complete its transformation it will need to understand its existing applications and how each of them can become part of the new era. By understanding the business, technical, and economic objectives a company can decide whether an application should be altered or not, and whether it will run best in a private or public cloud environment.
